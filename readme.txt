A professional RF calculator that converts frequencies to wavelengths using the speed of light.

== Description ==

The RF Frequency to Wavelength Calculator plugin provides a professional calculator tool that helps determine the wavelength of electromagnetic waves based on their frequency. This is essential for RF engineers, ham radio operators, and anyone working with wireless communications.

**Features:**

* Convert frequencies in Hz, kHz, MHz, and GHz to wavelengths in meters
* Real-time AJAX calculations for smooth user experience
* Mobile-responsive design
* Educational content with wave diagram and formula explanation
* Professional styling that matches modern web standards
* Shortcode support for easy embedding

**Usage:**

Simply add the shortcode `[rf_calculator]` to any post or page where you want the calculator to appear.

You can also customize the title:
`[rf_calculator title="Your Custom Title"]`

**Technical Details:**

* Uses the exact speed of light value: 299,792,458 m/s
* Formula: Î» = c / f (wavelength = speed of light / frequency)
* Results displayed with 6 decimal place precision
* Secure AJAX implementation with nonce verification

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/rf-calculator-plugin` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the shortcode `[rf_calculator]` in your posts or pages.
